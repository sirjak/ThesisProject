# Thesis
In my thesis, I took a View-based Android application, ARMuseum, to migrate it into Compose components. Unfortunately, I ran out of time during the migration process and was unable to fully finish it during the time allocated for my thesis. However, I do plan on continuing with the migration alongside my job hunt during this summer but the results from it won't make it to the actual thesis as it has already been published.
